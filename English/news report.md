11月26日，世界卫生组织召开紧急会议，会后决定将2天前南非上报的新冠病毒新变异株列为最高关注等级，并将毒株命名为奥密克戎（Omicron）

专家认为，该变异毒株比现在的主流病毒Delta传播性更高，且很有可能令现在大部分疫苗效力降低。不过，目前针对该病毒的研究依然处于早期阶段，尚缺乏更具体详尽的实验测试数据支撑。目前，全球范围内，南非、以色列、博茨瓦纳、比利时和中国香港均出现奥密克戎变异病毒感染者。

On November 26, the World Health Organization (WHO) held an emergency meeting, after which it decided to classify the new variant of the new coronavirus reported in South Africa two days ago as the highest level of concern, and named the strain Omicron.

Experts believe that this mutant strain is more transmissible than the current mainstream virus Delta and is likely to make most vaccines less effective. However, research on the virus is still in its early stages, and more specific and detailed experimental testing data is lacking. Globally, the Omicron variant has been reported in South Africa, Israel, Botswana, Belgium, and Hong Kong, China.
